# ad-libs.js


A collection of cross-browser methods for use with front-end development. Ad-Libs is a tool that supports various browser
and OS combinations dating back to IE5. It uses feature detection to determine the user's environment and outputs details
pertaining to that OS and browser.

## Installation
```bash
npm install https://github.com/conversant/ad-libs.js
```
## Usage

Each function is exported as a single commonjs module, allowing only the needed modules to be
bundled into a project to keep minified bundles as small as possible.

In Node.js:
```js
// Load the full ad-libs.js build.
var ad-libs = require('ad-libs.js');

// Load a single module for smaller builds with webpack.
var domReady = require('ad-libs.js/lib/dom/domReady');
var browser = require('ad-libs.js/lib/detect/browser');
```

## Detection Modules

There are several modules that use feature detection to determine the user's environment. In order to populate the resulting
objects, the detect function must be executed.

For example, in order to populate the browser object:
```js
var browser = require('ad-libs.js/lib/detect/browser').detect();

// outputs the name of the os
console.log(browser.os.name)
```
